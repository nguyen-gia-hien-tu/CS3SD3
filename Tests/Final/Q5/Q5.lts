BSEMA = (up -> down -> BSEMA).
PROCESS = (console.up -> console.down -> PROCESS).
set Processes = {user[1..2], system[1..2]}

||OS = (Processes : PROCESS || Processes :: console : BSEMA).

// user process may be denied access to the console when
// system processes have higher priority than user processes
// uncomment the line below and comment the ||OS line above to check
// ||OS = (Processes : PROCESS || Processes :: console : BSEMA) >> {user}.
