// Q1a)

// Assume the user can print 3 jobs before running out of toner
const N = 3
range J = 0..N

// the user prints
USER = (print -> USER).

// the technician fills the toner whenever the printer is out of toner
// i.e., after N number of printing jobs
TECHNICIAN = (fill_toner -> TECHNICIAN).

// the printer starts off with full toner, then for each printing job,
// we reduce the number of prints left.
// When the number of prints left is 0, this means the printer is out of toner,
// so we need to fill the toner
PRINTER = PRINTER[N],
PRINTER[i:J] = ( when (i == 0) fill_toner -> PRINTER[N]
			   | when (i > 0) print -> PRINTER[i - 1]
