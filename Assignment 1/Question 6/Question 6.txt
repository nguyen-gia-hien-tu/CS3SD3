Question 6:

a)
The FSP after rewriting the process is (writing in LTSA syntax style):

A = (a -> A1 | c -> D | c -> C),
B = (b -> E2),
C = (a -> B2 | a -> C),

A1 = (b -> A),
B1 = (c -> B),
D  = (a -> C | c -> B),
E1 = (a -> A | b -> B),
E2 = (a -> B | c -> E1),
B2 = (b -> B1).


The LTS is given in "Q6a Hand Drawn.png" file.


b)
The LTS generated by the LTSA using the FSP above is given in "Q6b.png" file.
Initially, the LTS generated by the LTSA looks different from the hand drawn
LTS. However, by re-arranging the states, the two LTS are actually the same.
The following states in the hand drawn LTS correspond to the states in the
LTS generated by LTSA:
A  -  0
B  -  4
C  -  1
A1 -  8
B1 -  3
D  -  7
E1 -  6
E2 -  5
B2 -  2


Although the hand drawn LTS is different from the LTSA-generated LTS, the
LTSA-generated LTS using the above FSP is exactly the same as the LTSA-
generated LTS using the FSP given the question description.

The .lts file name using the FSP above is "Q6 Relabeled FSP.lts"
The .lts file name using the FSP in the question description is "Q6 Original FSP.lts"
