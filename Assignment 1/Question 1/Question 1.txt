Question 1:
I write FSP in LTSA code so that you can copy and paste into the LTSA for testing.
Mahdee also stated that it is fine to write FSP in LTSA syntax.
The .lts files are also given in case you cannot copy from this file to LTSA.

a)
/**
FSP for process P1 in Question 1 Assignment 1
*/
P1 = A,
A  = (a -> B | a -> D),
B  = (b -> C | c -> D),
C  = (a -> D | b -> A | d -> C),
D  = (d -> A).


/**

P2 = A,
A  = (b -> B | b -> C),
B  = (b -> E | d -> D),
C  = (c -> B),
D  = (a -> A | b -> E | d -> C),
E  = (a -> A | c -> C).


/**
FSP process P3 in Question 1 Assignment 1
*/
P3 = A,
A  = (a -> D | b -> B),
B  = (a -> A | a -> C),
C  = (b -> B | b -> D | c -> C),
D  = (a -> C | c -> A).



b)
The LTSA for FSP P1 is given in the "Q1 P1.png" file.
The LTSA for FSP P2 is given in the "Q1 P2.png" file.
The LTSA for FSP P3 is given in the "Q1 P3.png" file.

The general labelled transition systems may look different to the given graphs at first,
but after rearranging the nodes (the states) in the generated labelled transition systems,
they will be the same as the given corresponding graphs.
	1. Process P1: The states A, B, C, D in the given graph correspond to the states
	   0, 2, 3, 1 in the labelled transition system
	2. Process P2: The states A, B, C, D in the given graph correspond to the states
	   0, 2, 1, 3, 4
	3. Process P3: The states A, B, C, D in the given graph correspond to the states
	   0, 1, 2, 3
